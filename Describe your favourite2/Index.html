        <h1>Hello!!!this is ausmeen,today I am going to tell about my favourite hobby that is playing badminton   </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
            <p> I like badminton most of all sports. I play badminton with my brother every day. I love playing this game in winter. Our teachers help in playing badminton in school. There are at least two people required for playing badminton. And at most four people can play this game. Our teachers also tell us about the advantages of playing this game. Our body stays healthy by playing this game. Not only badminton but any outdoor game is very good for our health. Badminton is very easy and it is also an outdoor sport. Due to this, badminton is my favorite sport.Badminton is a very old sport that started in British India. British India means when the British (British) ruled India. In this sport, two rackets and a shuttlecock are used. In many badminton courts, there is also a trap between the two players. Light and thin cotton are used in rackets. The shuttlecock is made of rubber and feathers. During the game, the players throw this shuttlecock with the help of a racket towards each other. According to whose side the shuttlecock falls, the front player gets a point. The maximum score in this game is 21. The player who scores more points within the given time will be the winner.</p>
